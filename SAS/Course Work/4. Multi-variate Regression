4.19. THe positive 5059 for promo*daygame indicates that promo during daygames result in higher attendance. A pratical reason could be 
universities or schools promoting sports and taking advantage of this promotions during the day. 
The negative 4690 indicates that promotions are not working extremely during the weekends. One reason could be games in the weekends are held in the 
night and people who favour day games might not be as attracted to it.   */

4.20aThe data for stocks fits the linear trend better than the data for the mutual firms.  
4.20b. From the results we can see the value of the DS(dummy variable for stock firms). Beta2 will be how much longer stock firms will take
in general as compared to mutual firms in adopting the new innovation. 
4.20c. As the p-value is lesser than alpha = 0.01, we reject H0 in favour of alternate, signifying beta2. 
       4.97703<95%CL(beta2)<11.13391. It is important to consider firm type when predicting adoption speeds as stocks firms take a longer time
       than mutual firms. 
4.20d. As the p-value is much greater than 0.05, we can conclude that interaction of x and DS is not significantly affecting y.
